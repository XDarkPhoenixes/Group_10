Background:
Customer retention is an important KPI for companies with a subscription-based business model. Customer churn is defined as the percentage of customers that stopped using your companyâ€™s product or service during a certain time frame. 

Purpose
The ability to predict customer churn in advance allows companies to retain customers at the highest risk of churn by proactively engaging with them. This represents a huge additional potential revenue source for companies. 

Specifics of the Customer Churn Predictive Model
One of the ways of calculating a churn rate is to divide the number of customers lost during a given time interval by the number of active customers at the beginning of the period. Specifically, a customer churn predictive model predicts the churn within that given time interval. This time interval depends on the use-case; it could be one month, three months, or even six months in advance. The cut-off date for the interval must be carefully determined and no information after the cut-off date should be used in the machine learning model.
